    However, as you may have realized by now, CMake is a huge ecosystem, and one book
    is not enough to cover the vast number of topics that can be discussed. Thus,
    in this chapter, we are going to take a look at the resources that will help you
    understand CMake even better as well as the ways of getting involved in the CMake
    project itself.

    As a result, CMake has an ever-growing community supporting it. There are plenty
    of resources available online for learning and troubleshooting the CMake problems
    that you may experience.

    maintains development activity for CMake in a dedicated GitLab instance at [https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake).
    Having everything available as open source and transparent means that getting
    involved in CMake is pretty easy. You can view the issues, merge requests, and
    get involved in the development of CMake. If you believe you have discovered a
    bug in CMake or want to make a feature request, you can create a new issue at
    [https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues).
    If you have an idea about improving CMake, discuss that idea by creating an issue
    first. You can also take a look at open merge requests at [https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests)
    to assist in reviewing the code being developed.
