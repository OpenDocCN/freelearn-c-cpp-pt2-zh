- en: As we should have learned by now, every big project comes with its own set of
    dependencies. The easiest way of dealing with these dependencies is by using a
    package manager, such as **Conan** or **vcpkg**. But using a package manager might
    not always be possible or feasible, due to company policies, project requirements,
    or lack of resources. Thus, the project authors might consult traditional, old-style
    ways of dealing with dependencies. The usual way of dealing with these dependencies
    may include shipping all dependencies embedded into the repository’s build code.
    Alternatively, project authors may decide to let the end user deal with the dependencies
    from scratch. Neither of these ways is clean and has its own drawbacks. What if
    I told you there is a middle ground? Welcome to the *super-build* approach.

- en: A super-build is a method that can be used to decouple the logic required for
    satisfying dependencies from project code, like how package managers work. In
    fact, we can call this method *the poor man’s package manager*. Separating the
    dependency logic from the project code allows us to have a more flexible and maintainable
    project structure. In this chapter, we will learn how to achieve this in detail.

- en: Super-builds can be structured as a grand build that builds multiple projects
    or as an in-project submodule that deals with dependencies. Therefore, having
    the means of acquiring repositories is a must. Fortunately, CMake has stable and
    established ways of doing so. To name a few, `ExternalProject` and `FetchContent`
    are the most popular CMake modules for dealing with external dependencies. We
    will be using the `FetchContent` CMake module in our examples, since it is cleaner
    and easier to deal with. Please note that using the means provided by CMake is
    not a strict requirement but a convenience. A super-build can also be structured
    by using version control system utilities, such as `git submodule` or `git subtree`.
    Since CMake is this book’s focal point and Git’s support of `FetchContent` is
    quite decent, we prefer to utilize it.

    Dealing with local project code is the easiest, but software projects are rarely
    standalone. Things may get complicated quickly without a proper dependency management
    strategy. The first recommendation of this chapter is to *use a package manager
    or a dependency provider if you can*. As described in [*Chapter 5*](B30947_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor084),
    *Integrating Third-Party Libraries and Dependency Management*, package managers
    greatly reduce the effort spent on dependency management. If you are not able
    to use a pre-built package manager, you may need to roll your very own mini project-specific
    package manager, which is called a **super-build**.
  prefs: []

    which means the project is able to satisfy its very own dependencies without the
    intervention of the user. Having such an ability is very convenient for all consumers.
    To demonstrate this technique, we will start with an example of such a scenario.

    call is made to define an alias target named `GTest::Main` for the `gtest_main`
    target. This is done to keep the compatibility between `find_package(…)` and super-build
    target names. There is no alias target defined for `benchmark`, since its `find_package(…)`

    and links the `Catch2` library to the target. You may have noticed that this example
    does not use `FindPackage(...)` to discover the `Catch2` library. The reason for
    this is that, unlike `FetchContent`, `ExternalProject` fetches and builds the
    external dependencies at build time. Since the content of the `Catch2` library
    is not available at configuration time, we are unable to use `FindPackage(...)`
    here. `FindPackage(…)` runs at configure time and requires the package files to
    be present. Let’s take a look at `superbuild.cmake` as well:'

- en: The `superbuild.cmake` module includes the `ExternalProject` CMake module. The
    code calls the `ExternalProject_Add` function to declare a target named `catch2_download`
    with the `GIT_REPOSITORY`, `GIT_TAG`, `INSTALL_COMMAND`, and `CMAKE_ARGS` arguments.
    As you may recall from previous chapters, the `ExternalProject_Add` function can
    fetch dependencies from different sources. Our example is trying to fetch the
    dependency via using Git. The `GIT_REPOSITORY` and `GIT_TAG` arguments are for
    specifying the target Git repository URL and the tag to be checked out after the
    `git clone` respectively. Since `Catch2` is a CMake project, the number of parameters
    we need to supply to the `ExternalProject_Add` function is minimal. The `ExternalProject_Add`
    function knows how to configure, build, and install a CMake project by default,
    so no `CONFIGURE_COMMAND` or `BUILD_COMMAND` argument is needed. The empty `INSTALL_COMMAND`
    argument is for disabling and installing the dependency after the build. The last
    argument, `CMAKE_ARGS`, is for passing CMake arguments to the external project’s
    configure step. We use this to suppress a GCC warning (treated as an error) about
    legacy pragmas in the `Catch2` compilation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `ExternalProject_Add` command fetches the desired library into a prefix
    path and builds it. So, to use the fetched content, we have to import it to the
    project first. Since we cannot utilize `FindPackage(...)` to let CMake deal with
    the importing of the library, we have some manual work to do. One of them is to
    define the `include` directory of the `Catch2` target. Since `Catch2` is a header-only
    library, defining an interface target with the headers will be sufficient. We
    are declaring the `CATCH2_INCLUDE_DIR` variable to set the directory that will
    contain the `Catch2` headers. We are using this variable to set the `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
    property of the imported target created in this example. Up next, the file (`MAKE_DIRECTORY
    ${CATCH2_INCLUDE_DIR}`) CMake command is called to create the include directory.
    The reason for that is, because of how `ExternalProject_Add` works, the `Catch2`
    content is not present until the build step executes. Setting a target’s `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
    requires the given directories to be present, so we’re doing a small hack as a
    workaround. In the last three lines, we declare an `IMPORTED INTERFACE` library
    for `Catch2`, making this library dependent on the `catch2_download` target and
    setting `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of the imported library.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Version consistency is an important aspect of all software projects. As you
    should have learned by now, nothing is set in stone in the software world. Software
    evolves and changes over time. Such changes often need to be acknowledged in advance,
    either by running a series of tests against the new version or by making changes
    to the consuming code itself. Ideally, changes in upstream code should not have
    an effect on reproducing existing builds, until we want them to do so. A project’s
    `x.y` version should always be built with the `z.q` dependency version if the
    software verification and testing have been done against this combination. The
    reason for this is that the smallest changes in an upstream dependency may affect
    the behavior of your software, even though there are no API or ABI changes. Your
    software will not have well-defined behavior if version consistency is not provided.
    Thus, having a way to provide version consistency is very crucial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ensuring version consistency in a super-build depends on the way that the super-build
    is organized. For repositories fetched over a version control system, it is relatively
    easy. Instead of cloning a project and using it as is, check out to a specific
    branch or tag. If there are no such anchor points, check out to a specific commit
    instead. This will futureproof your super-build. But even this may not be enough.
    Tags may get overridden, branches may be force-pushed, and history may be rewritten.
    To mitigate this risk, you may prefer to fork the project and use that as upstream
    instead. This way, you will have total control over the content that upstream
    has. But bear in mind that this method comes with a maintenance burden.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The moral of the story is, do not track an upstream blindly. Always keep an
    eye on recent changes. For third-party dependencies that are consumed as archive
    files, always check for their hash digest. This way, you will ensure that you
    are indeed using the intended revision for your project, and if there is a change,
    you will have to manually acknowledge it.
