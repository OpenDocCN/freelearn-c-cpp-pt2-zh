    engineer capable of building all kinds of projects with CMake. The final step
    in becoming a CMake professional is learning how to introduce and automate various
    quality checks and prepare your projects for collaborative work and publication.
    High-quality projects developed within large companies often share the same philosophy:
    automate repetitive tasks that drain mental energy from important decisions.'

    all kinds of tests done during the build: code-style checks, unit tests, and static
    and dynamic analyses of our solutions. We''ll also simplify the documentation
    process by using tooling to generate pretty web pages, and we''ll package and
    install our project to make its consumption a breeze, both for other developers
    and end users.'
