- en: The software world and the tooling we use to create software are evolving every
    single day. CMake is no exception; over the past twenty years, it has continually
    evolved and is now considered an industry standard for building C++ applications.
    Despite CMake’s extensive features and comprehensive documentation, real-world
    examples and guidelines on how to effectively use these features together are
    rare. This is where CMake Best Practices steps in.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than delving into every detail and feature of CMake, this book provides
    examples to illustrate how CMake can be used effectively for various tasks in
    building software, without covering every single edge case—other books serve that
    purpose. The aim of this book is to keep things as simple as possible while covering
    the recommended best practices for getting things done. The rationale behind this
    approach is that you don’t need to know all of CMake’s capabilities to accomplish
    your everyday tasks.

- en: We tried to illustrate all concepts with concrete examples, that you can try
    out yourself. Since the audience of this book is primarily engineers, we have
    tailored the content accordingly. While writing this book, we are software engineers
    first and authors second. As a result, the content is more practical than theoretical.
    It is a compendium of carefully selected proven techniques that you can use in
    your everyday CMake workflow.

    what CMake is in a nutshell, then jumps right into installing CMake and building
    something with CMake. You learn how to install the latest stable version manually,
    even if not provided by your package manager. You’ll also learn about the basic
    concepts behind CMake and why it is a build system generator and not a build system
    itself. Learn how it fits into modern software development with C++ (And C).'
