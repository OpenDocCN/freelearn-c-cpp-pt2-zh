    this book before it goes on sale. It can take many months to write a book, but
    our authors have cutting-edge information to share with you today. Early Access
    gives you an insight into the latest developments by making chapter drafts available.
    The chapters may be a little rough around the edges right now, but our authors
    will update them over time. You’ll be notified when a new version is ready.'

    means you have the opportunity to have your say about the content. We want to
    publish books that provide useful information to you and other customers, so we’ll
    send questionnaires out to you regularly. All feedback is helpful, so please be
    open about your thoughts and opinions. Our editors will work their magic on the
    text of the book, so we’d like your input on the technical elements and your experience
    as a reader. We’ll also provide frequent updates on how our authors have changed
    their chapters based on your feedback.
