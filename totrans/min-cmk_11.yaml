- en: Now that we have a fully functioning application, we want some guarantees it’ll
    keep working, which is where testing comes in. We’ll show how to use the accompanying
    CMake tool, CTest, to provide support for many kinds of tests for your libraries
    and applications. After creating an application, the most critical requirement
    is the ability to share it with others (and ensure it doesn’t just work on your
    machine). This is where packaging comes in; we’ll show how to use another CMake
    adjacent tool called CPack to make distributable packages for Windows, macOS,
    and Linux. Finally, we’ll look at the various tools available today that integrate
    seamlessly with CMake and make working with it even easier. By the end of the
    book, you’ll have learned a lot, but there’s always more to discover; so, we’ll
    take some time to look at what other resources are available to help you continue
    your CMake journey.
