- en: Creating top-notch software is no easy task. Developers researching this subject
    online often struggle to determine which advice is current and which methods have
    been superseded by newer, better practices. Moreover, most resources explain the
    process chaotically, lacking proper background, context, and structure.

    by treating the building of C++ solutions comprehensively. It not only teaches
    you how to use CMake in your projects but also highlights what makes them maintainable,
    elegant, and clean. The guide walks you through automating complex tasks common
    in many projects, including building, testing, and packaging.'

    creating packages. As you progress, you will learn to compile and link executables
    and libraries, understand these processes in detail, and optimize each step for
    the best results. Additionally, you will discover how to incorporate external
    dependencies into your project, such as third-party libraries, testing frameworks,
    program analysis tools, and documentation generators. Finally, you’ll learn how
    to export, install, and package your solution for both internal and external use.
