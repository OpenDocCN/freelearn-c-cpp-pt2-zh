- en: After getting our application up and running with the help of CMake, and creating
    our first library, we’ll next focus on making working with CMake easier (a topic
    we’ll return to throughout the book). This will make day-to-day usage easier and
    improve the onboarding experience for any new developers wishing to get set up
    with your project. Returning to our application, we’ll introduce a new command
    that can better handle larger dependencies, decoupling them from the main build.
    We’ll then turn the tables and show what is needed to make your own libraries
    available this way, so both you and others can depend on the useful functionality
    you’ve built. *Part 2* will close by showing you how to simplify the build to
    reduce the number of manual steps required and ensure we can produce an executable
    from multiple dependencies with a single CMake command.
