    By adding tests to our solution, we reduce the risk of making obvious mistakes
    in the business code. But that won't be enough to avoid more intricate problems.
    Every piece of software consists of so many details that keeping track of them
    all becomes a full-time job. There are dozens of conventions and multiple special
    design practices agreed upon by teams maintaining the product.

    particularly tricky in C++, as programmers have tremendous control over how they
    manage memory. All kinds of mistakes are possible: reading unallocated memory,
    reading memory that was already freed, attempting to free memory more than once,
    and writing to incorrect addresses. Developers obviously try to avoid these, but
    since these bugs are so inconspicuous, they can sneak into even the simplest programs.
    Sometimes, all it takes is a forgotten variable initialization and we''re in a
    pinch.'

    the numbers of spaces, newlines, and the ordering of `#import` statements have
    been codified. This isn't done out of pettiness, but to save time. By following
    the practices outlined in this chapter, we don't need to worry about formatting
    code correctly by hand. It will automatically get formatted as a side effect of
    building – a step that we have to do anyway to check whether the code is working
    correctly. By introducing ClangFormat, we can also ensure that it looks proper.
