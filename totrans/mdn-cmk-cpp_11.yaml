    use them without installation, as well as how to install our projects so that
    they can easily be used by any program on the system. In particular, we'll learn
    how to configure our project so that it can automatically put different artifact
    types in the correct directory. To handle more advanced scenarios, we'll introduce
    low-level commands for installing files and directories, as well as for executing
    custom scripts and CMake commands.

    when `INSTALL_PREFIX` is `/usr`. Figuring out the correct path for every platform
