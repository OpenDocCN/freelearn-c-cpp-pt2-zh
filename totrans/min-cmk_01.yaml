- en: The first part of this book begins by ensuring you have everything you need
    to get started with CMake, whether you’re on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Once your
    environment is up and running, we’ll introduce CMake itself, starting with the
    foundations of our project, which will evolve throughout the course of this book.
    With our simple application operational, we’ll turn our attention to how to use
    other people’s code with the help of CMake by showing how easy it can be to bring
    in third-party dependencies in a clean and succinct way. Before moving on to *Part
    2* of the book, we’ll show how to extract part of our application into a reusable
    library that itself can be shared with others and used by our main application.
